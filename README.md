# WinToGo-Fishy
Status: Alpha - Very early stage, do not use.

### Description:
Its `Windows To Go`, but it will work with any Windows 8.1/10 Enterprise Iso. For those that dont know it, `Windows To Go` is the much raved about thing, where you can run Windows off a Usb, but who actually has done this? Due to the control over what Isos it can be done with, limits most people whom take the time to try, to ending up giving up on the idea. Additionally, what makes Windows on a Usb a good idea specifically now, is the abundance of `External USB =>150MB/s nVMe drives` currently, as apposed to the 10-20MB/s USBs of previous generations. If people can put a usb drive in to do that small thing they still do on windows, then they may be more free to choose other OS as their main. It is also useful for people on the go, or round their mates house, or even just their pc died, or even drive cloning, etc.

### Requirements:
- Windows 8.1/10 Enterprise (Windows 10 Enterprise should be <=1909).

### Instruction:
- There is the batch, the batch runs the powershell script, magic happens.

### Notation:
- if this works, it will likely be merged with some other project later.
