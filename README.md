# WinToGo-Fishy
Status: Alpha - Very early stage, do not use.

### Development:
- Upons Selecting 1 from the menu, it states "Enter ISO/WIM Path". Need clarity on what it expects, but its not producing any options as is.
- Note, this is still very much an experiment, I do not know if it can be done, and on a limited search I could find no similar project.

### Description:
Its `Windows To Go`, but it will work with any Windows 8.1/10 Enterprise Iso. For those that dont know it, `Windows To Go` is the much raved about thing, where you can run Windows off a Usb, but who actually has done this? Due to the control over what Isos it can be done with, limits most people whom take the time to try, to ending up giving up on the idea. Additionally, what makes Windows on a Usb a good idea specifically now, is the abundance of `External USB =>150MB/s nVMe drives` currently, as apposed to the 10-20MB/s USBs of previous generations. If people can put a usb drive in to do that small thing they still do on windows, then they may be more free to choose other OS as their main. It is also useful for people on the go, or round their mates house for gaming, or even just their pc died soes drive cloning, etc.

### Requirements:
- Windows 8.1/10 Enterprise (Windows 10 Enterprise should be <=1909).
- Powershell 5, so as, immediately compatible with Windows 10 and Compatible with Windows 8.1 with update.

### Instruction:
- There is the batch, the batch runs the powershell script, magic happens.

### Notation:
- if this works, it will likely be merged with some other project later, to create a swiss army knife.
