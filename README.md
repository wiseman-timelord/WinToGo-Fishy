# WinToGo-Fishy
Status: Alpha - Very early stage, do not use.

### Description:
Its `Windows To Go`, but it will work with any Windows 8.1/10 Iso. For those that dont know it, `Windows To Go` is the much raved about thing, where you can run Windows off a Usb, but who actually has done this? Due to the control over what Isos it can be done with, limits most people whom take the time to try, to ending up giving up on the idea. Lets change that.

### Requirements:
- Windows 8.1/10 Enterprise (Windows 10 Enterprise should be <=1909).

### Instruction:
- There is the batch, the batch runs the powershell script, magic happens.

### Notation:
- obviously they trialed it, but didnt want people doing that; my idea is, if people can just put a usb drive in, and do that small thing on windows, then their main OS would more likely be linux.
- if this works, it will likely be merged with some other project later.
